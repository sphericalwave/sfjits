I received my purple belt last night.
I've heard it said that purple belt is the first advanced belt.
There's definitely a sense of pride there.

The strategy that's gotten me this far is
- focus on pin and submission escapes
- develop half guard and open guard
- pass in both direction
- pass from half guard
- attack the back
- watch video series by great instructors
- remove physical limitations via mobility daily
- compete a couple times a year
- learn from your mistakes
- train because you enjoy it
- don't focus on belts
