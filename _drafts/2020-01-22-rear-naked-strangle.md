Hadaka Jime (裸絞め) means naked strangle in Japanese
Mata Leon means Lion Killer in Portugese

John Danaher calls it the rear naked strangle.
A choke is an obstruction of the windpipe.
A strangle is an occlusion of the arteries supplying oxygen to the brain.

It can takes minutes to choke someone.
The rear choke is painful and dangerous.

A strangle takes seconds and causes minimal pain.
