      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>Aaron is a purple belt and electrical engineer.
        He likes back attacks and standing guard passing.
        His favorite submissions are Hadaka Jime and Ichiru Sankaku.
        His favorite move is the rolling back attack but he'll settle for half guard passing.
        He's currently developing his Feet to Floor skills.
        And he doesn't like wrestling, too inefficient.
        His goal has been to be a Superfluid Jiujitsu Blackbelt, since white belt.
