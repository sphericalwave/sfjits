Rob is a tank.
He inspires fear and respect in white belts and blue belts everywhere.
Rob is a fun guy to roll against because it's always a challenge.
He's one of the most consistent guys on the mats, and has been for years.

Though I outweigh Rob by 15 ibs, it rarely seems that way.
Rob will roll 10 rounds and still be looking around the room for more souls to consume.
He's hard to sweep and loves to setup shop in the split squat position and smash your guard.

Rob is a bit of a sand bagger because he's got 3 stripes on the purple beltch.
And he goes around with one that's falling off because he doesn't care about rank.
I think he's closing on brown belt.
But I don't understand how promotions work.

He's here to compete and evolve, it seems.
But you never know he might secretly be a vigilante.
