The upright go is a great wearable for working at a desk with optimum posture.
It simply buzzes to remind you to sit up straight.

The better your posture the more structurally sturdy you will be on the mats.
Posture appears to be largely habitual.

If you slouch all the time you'll get better at slouching.
The converse is also true.

I prefer the magnetic necklace over the stickers.
