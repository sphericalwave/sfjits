Long time training partner and perpetual antagonist Alex earned his black belt today.
Alex was a white belt when I first met him in 2012.
He allegedly started 6 months ahead of me.
And there hasn't been a training session he hasn't been killing me on the mats.
I've been calling him "the Wolverine" though he's more of an academic like "Beast", one of the smarter guys I know.

I fell off the jits wagon for a couple of years because of engineering school and later working in Newfoundland.
When i cam back Alex was a brown belt.

For the last four years Alex taught many of classes that I attended and laid the smack down at open rolls.
We were all pretty much in awe of his ability, a lethal combination of ferocity and technicality. He's also a terrific teacher with a commanding presence.
He has since gone to open his own gym with his famous cousin TJ Grant.
So I don't get beat up by him as much these days. Except occasionally at his open mats.

It's awesome to see a friend get his black belt and be recognized for a level of mastery.
Mostly because that's a level I aspire to and also it's great to see someone achieve sustained success.

Alex doesn't seem invincible to me anymore as a purple belt but I still wouldn't bet against him in a death match.
My perspective now is he has more mat time solving bio-mechanical riddles under pressure.
It seems like jits is an accumulation of tactics and techniques, and when you're a blue belt you still don't know much compared to a black belt.
So it's a change of context and each person travels their own path.
Alex certainly knows a lot about jiujitsu, including the obnoxious worm guard.

P.S. Shout out to Cam Daniels who also got his black belt, a cool guy and killer on the mats.
I don't Cam as well but last time I rolled with him he tapped me at least 3 times.

Shine on you crazy Diamonds!
