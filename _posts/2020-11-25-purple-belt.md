I received my purple belt last night.
I've heard it said that purple belt is the first advanced belt.
There's definitely a sense of pride there.
Looking back I can see I've come a long way.

The strategy that's gotten me this far is
- focus on pin and submission escapes
- develop half guard and open guard
- pass in both direction
- pass from half guard
- attack the back
- watch video series by great instructors
- remove physical limitations via mobility daily
- compete a couple times a year
- learn from your mistakes
- train because you enjoy it
- don't focus on belts

I wasn't the only promotion prior to lockdown 2.0.

Kealan got his fourth stripe.
Kealan is a handful to deal with.
If he takes mount watch out.
That Ezikiel is coming for ya.
Kealan is the man with the hidden jiujitsu plan.
Respect Kealan!

The Wizard Khalifa earned two stripes on his blue belt.
Khalifa is quick and he won't tap unless he's going to sleep.
He's been having some trouble with his ankles.
I've been preaching shinrolls and shooter squats, dunno if it's helping.

Brian must have 4 stripes by now.
Brian is an big, strong guy with solid base.
I think he trained judo once upon a time.

Aristotle is the energizer bunny and earned 2 stripes.
Aristotle has a great attitude and endless cardio.
We've gone running before and after finishing the run he'll go again.
Or do a big calithenics workout.
It's going to be interesting watching his game develop because he's a small guy.
He'll have to be technical.

Zack got his fourth stripe.
Zack is another dog to roll with.
He has more of an MMA, wrestling style.
Double leg passes, will compete for top position.
Great attitude, mellow pleasant dude.
He has Mutant flexibility and has competed in MMA.
Might be nuts?

Sam got two stripes.
I'm amazed women even train jits.
It's such a gnarly, painful, dangerous hobby in the initial phases and they're rolling with dudes much bigger, heavier, stronger.
It's quite amazing.
Way to go Sam.

Josh got three stripes.
Josh is long, strong and a great attitude.
Josh is fun to joke around with.

For whatever reason I tend to miss stripes being given out so I striped up my blue
belt before wrapping it up for good. Blue and black are my favorite colors so I'll miss
wearing that dashing combo.

Onward and upwards.
